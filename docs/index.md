# Hi I'm Andrew
Welcome to my blog. I want to document things that I feel like people should know about. I attempted to write a book a few times but I've never been able to put all of the thoughts together in one place, so I thought I'd start a blog and I can add to it sporatically. 

## What is this?
This is the blog, sortof. I want it to be documentation about... stuff. My goal is to dump information here and people who want to use it can. Nothing you find here is going to help you become a master in a thing, but I hope it's enough to get you started. I want it to be a resource people can use to get enough of an understanding in something to learn more if they want to. 

## Who am I?
I'm a programmer. When I'm not being a programmer i'm bad at sitting still. I have no credentials worth mentioning. I like to learn way too much about anything I can get my hands on though. That comes with it's advantages and it's faults. I know... some amount... about a lot of things. I wouldn't say I've ever mastered any of them.
